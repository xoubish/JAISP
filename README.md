# JAISP

JAISP (Joint AI Survey Processing) is an active research codebase for developing AI methods that operate jointly on heterogeneous astronomical surveys.

The goal is to build end-to-end pipelines that learn shared representations across surveys (e.g., Euclid and Rubin) and support core inference tasks such as astrometry, deblending, and photometry using real overlapping data. Emphasis is placed on physical correctness, uncertainty propagation, and validation against downstream science metrics rather than standalone model performance.

Development proceeds incrementally, starting from data handling and representations, with modeling and task-specific components added and revised as the system evolves.
